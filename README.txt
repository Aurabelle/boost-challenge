I realise that this was a little over time, but I wanted to be able to
submit something that had at least one test! I was pretty sure that
Andy mentioned time wasn't the highest concern but I have tried to keep it in
mind, hence why there is only one test.

To run the solution simply type ruby atbash.rb, and it should go from there.
